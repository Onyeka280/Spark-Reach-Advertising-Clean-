# Spark-Reach-Advertising-Clean-
Cleaning data set provided by Spark Reach Advertising using Excel
In this project for Spark-Reach Advertising, a comprehensive data cleaning process on a 100,000-row Marketing Campaign Performance Dataset was conducted to enhance its suitability for analysis. The dataset contained inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and various data formatting issues that hindered accurate insights into campaign performance. To prepare the data for in-depth analysis, we standardized formats across all columns, including dates, percentages, and monetary values, ensuring uniformity. Missing values were identified and addressed, duplicate records were removed, and inconistencies in fields and categories were resolved. By improving data reliability and consistency, the cleaning efforts prepared the dataset for meaningful insights into campaign effectiveness, enabling data-driven decisions for future marketing strategies.
